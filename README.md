# Horus-X10S-Express-OpenTX
This repository contains the SD card contents and OTX file from my Horus X10S Express. You can use any of the models, model images, etc for your own learning and for your helis. You are expected to take your own precautions in ensuring the correct operation of my example models on your own radio and models.

If you are using your own X10S Express, everything should more or less just work when you use one of my models (always test first, though).  If you're using another one of the OTX ColorLCD radios (TX16S, Horus X10S, Jumper, etc), Companion can convert the models to work with your radio, but still make sure it does the conversion correctly before even thinking about flying with it.

Use this guide in conjunction with my own models and examples to learn how to use OpenTX for helicopters.
