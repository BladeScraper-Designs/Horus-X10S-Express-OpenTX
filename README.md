# Horus-X10S-Express-OpenTX
This repository contains the SD card contents and OTX file from my Horus X10S Express. You can use any of the models, model images, etc for your own learning and for your helis. You are expected to take your own precautions in ensuring the correct operation of my example models on your own radio and models.
